Civil Aviation - Predicting Flight and Delays

This project predicts port delays and flight fares using machine learning models based on various features like departure port, arrival port, weather conditions, and distances between ports e.t.c.

Before opening these files make sure you have these libraries installed:

1) Pandas
2) Numpy
3) scikit-learn
4) matplotlib
5) xgboost
6) math
7) pickle
8) PyTorch
   
Open these two files in the folder named:
1) model_gradient_boosting.ipynb
2) model_random_forest.ipynb

After opening these files Run the command on top Run All for both individually. Wait for the model to train.
